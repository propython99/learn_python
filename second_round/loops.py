# two types of loops for and while

# for loop:
        # scores = [10, 15, 18]

        # for loop works on iterables like lists, strings, dictionaries, sets, tuples, etc.
        # for i in scores:
        #     print(f"Congrats! You got a score of {i}")

#while loop:

        # # age -= 1 # this is equiavalent to age = age -1

        # while age>18 and age<26:
        #     print(f"age is {age}")
        #     age -= 1
